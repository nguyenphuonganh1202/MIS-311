- **Price** *(numeric)*: Final selling price of the shoe (dependent variable).  
- **Brand** *(categorical)*: Shoe brand (e.g., Crocs, Toms, Nike).  
- **Color** *(categorical)*: Color of the shoe.  
- **Size** *(numeric)*: Shoe size (e.g., 2.0, 3.0).  

## 🔍 Summary Statistics  

| Statistic     | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Mean Price    | 212.92    |
| Median Price  | 214.00    |
| Mode Price    | 347.00    |
| Min Price     | 80.00     |
| Max Price     | 350.00    |

### 📈 Brand-wise Average Prices

| Brand         | Average Price |
|---------------|----------------|
| Toms          | 129.00         |
| FILA          | 160.83         |

## 🧠 Insights  

- **Brand** has a strong influence on pricing.  
- **Size** is relatively constant across the dataset, and likely does not affect price.  
- **Color** variation was not analyzed quantitatively but may be explored in future versions.

## ✅ Conclusions  

Retailers and analysts can use these findings to:
- Compare price positioning across brands.
- Identify pricing outliers.
- Build dynamic pricing strategies based on brand perception.


## 🚀 Future Work

- Use regression analysis to predict price from brand, color, and size.
- Visualize color trends and pricing impact.
- Cluster shoes into pricing segments.
