|---------------|-----------|
| Mean Price    | 212.92    |
| Median Price  | 214.00    |
| Mode Price    | 347.00    |
| Min Price     | 80.00     |
| Max Price     | 350.00    |

### üìà Brand-wise Average Prices

| Brand         | Average Price |
|---------------|----------------|
| Toms          | 129.00         |
| FILA          | 160.83         |

## üß† Insights  

- **Brand** has a strong influence on pricing.  
- **Size** is relatively constant across the dataset, and likely does not affect price.  
- **Color** variation was not analyzed quantitatively but may be explored in future versions.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion and Implications

This analysis reveals that **brand identity is the most influential factor** in determining shoe price among the given variables. 

- **Toms** positions itself as the most affordable brand, while **Nike** and **Lavie** are in the mid-range segment.
- **Shoe size** shows little variation, suggesting it has minimal pricing impact.

- Use brand-based pricing insights to optimize pricing strategies.
- Target promotional efforts by brand segment (e.g., discount high-priced brands to boost volume).
- Monitor pricing benchmarks to avoid underpricing or overpricing compared to competitors.

For deeper insights, regression models or clustering techniques could be implemented in future analysis.
